The spouse may claim an increase in his or her hereditary portion against all the co-heirs or only individual ones. The court may decide that the spouse shall inherit the entire estate if the value thereof is so low that the spouse would suffer deprivation if the estate were to be divided.\n(2) If other heirs in the first order of succession lacking necessary means of subsistence inherit together with the decedent's spouse, the court may, following the heirs' claim, decide that they shall also inherit a part of that portion of the estate to which the spouse is entitled by an Act. An increase in their hereditary portion on account of the spouse's portion may be claimed by all or individual co-heirs.\n(3) Individual co-heirs lacking sufficient means of subsistence may claim an increase in their hereditary portion also on account of other co-heirs.\n(4) The court may decide that all co-heirs or one of them shall inherit the entire estate if the value thereof is so low that they would suffer deprivation were the estate to be divided.\n(5) In dealing with the claims referred to in this Article, the court shall take into account all the circumstances of each case, particularly the financial circumstances and earning capacity of the co-heirs, as well as the value of the estate.\n \n",
