    "content": " ACT\n107.  \nEncumbrances of compulsory portion\nIf the rights of a person nominated as a successor and entitled to compulsory portion are restricted by nominating a subsequent successor or an executor of the will, or if he or she is encumbered by a testamentary obligation, the restriction or encumbrance shall not be valid if the share of the estate bequeathed to him or her is less than one-half of the share of the estate belonging to him or her in intestacy.\nIf the bequeathed share of an estate is bigger, the person entitled to compulsory portion may claim the compulsory portion in case of renunciation of the share of the estate. The term for renunciation commences at the moment when the person entitled to compulsory portion becomes aware of the restriction or encumbrance.\nThe restriction of nomination of a person as a successor is equal to nomination of a person entitled to compulsory portion as a subsequent successor.\n\n",
