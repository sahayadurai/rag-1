A notarised agreement may be replaced by a judicial compromise made in the proceedings for divorce. In other cases neither of the spouses can undertake to dispose of a claim for set-off before the termination of the proprietary relationship.\n (5) A claim for set-off expires after three years as of the date the spouse becomes aware of the termination of the proprietary relationship, but not later than ten years after the termination of the proprietary relationship.\n\n",
