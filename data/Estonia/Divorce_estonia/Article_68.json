A court shall take the well-being of children and other important circumstances into particular account.\n (2) If a dwelling used as a common housing of the family is in sole ownership of one spouse or in common ownership of on spouse and a third party, a court shall grant the use of the dwelling to the other spouse only in case it is necessary to prevent injustice. The same applies if one spouse alone or with a third party has a real right in the registered immovable where the common housing of the family is located.\n (3) In the case of a dwelling used on the basis of a lease relationship, a court may order that one of the spouses continues to perform the residential lease contract entered into by both spouses as a lessee or that the other spouse becomes a party to the residential lease contract as a lessee in lieu of the spouse who entered into the contract. At the request of a lessor, a court may prescribe provision of security for the performance of a lease contract.\n (4) If a dwelling is used on the basis of a contract other than a residential lease contract, a court may transfer the rights arising from this contract to one of the spouses or order that the other spouse becomes a party to the contract in lieu of the spouse who entered into the contract.\n (5) In the cases provided for in subsection 2, the court may determine reasonable charge for the use of a dwelling. In case of significant changes in the circumstances, a court may amend a ruling made earlier concerning the transfer of the right of use of a dwelling or concerning determination of charge for use.\n\n",
