If the alienation relates to property subject to a lien or mortgage, the liens are not extinguished, and the mortgages are not cancelled until the purchaser deposits the price in the manner determined by the court or pays the creditors placed in the state of graduation provided for in the following paragraph.\nThe heir forms, again with the assistance of the notary, the state of graduation. Creditors  are ranked according to their respective rights of pre-emption. They are preferred to legatees. Among creditors not entitled to preemption, the inherited assets are distributed in proportion to their respective claims.\nIf, in order to satisfy the creditors, it is necessary to include in the liquidation also the object of a legatee of specie, on the sum remaining after the payment of the creditors the legatee of specie is preferred over the other legatees.\n\u00a0\n",
