However, those in progress can be continued, but the part of the price remaining after the payment of preferential and mortgage creditors must be distributed according to the graduation status provided for in ART499.\nTime-bound claims become due. The benefit of the time limit remains, however, when the claim is secured by collateral on assets the alienation of which is not necessary for the purposes of liquidation, and the collateral is capable of ensuring the full satisfaction of the claim.\nFrom the date of publication of the invitation to creditors provided for in Art. 498(3) the running of interest on unsecured claims is suspended. The creditors are however entitled, after the liquidation has been completed, to the payment of interest on any residual amount.\n\n",
