If the surplus does not exceed one-fourth, the legatee or donee may retain all of the property, compensating the legitimates in money.\nThe legatee or donee who is a legitimary may retain all of the property, provided that the value of the property does not exceed the amount of the available portion and the share he is entitled to as a legitimary.\n\n",
