After the liquidator has been appointed, forfeiture of the benefit can no longer be enforced.\nThe decree appointing the liquidator is entered in the register of inheritances, noted in the margin of the transcript prescribed by the second paragraph of ART484, and transcribed in the offices of the land registers of the places where the hereditary property is located and in the offices where movable property is registered.\nThe heir loses the administration of the property and is obliged to hand it over to the administrator. The acts of disposition that the heir makes after transcribing the decree appointing the liquidator are without effect with respect to creditors and legatees.\n\u00a0\n",
