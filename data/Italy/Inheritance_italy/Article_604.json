If it is written by the testator, it must be signed by him at the end of the provisions; if it is written in whole or in part by others, or if it is written by mechanical means, it must also bear the testator's signature on each half-sheet, joined or separate.\nA testator who can read but cannot write, or who was unable to affix his signature when he had his dispositions written, must also declare to the notary, who receives the will, that he has read it and add the cause which prevented him from signing it: this shall be mentioned in the deed of receipt.\nOne who does not know or cannot read cannot make a secret will.\n\u00a0\n",
