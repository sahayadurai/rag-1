This constitutes an enforceable title against the heir.\nThe placement of conditional claims does not prevent the payment of later creditors, provided they give security.\nCreditors and legatees who have not appeared have an action against the heir only to the extent of the amount remaining after payment of creditors and legatees placed in the state of graduation. This action prescribes in three years from the day on which the status became final or the judgment pronouncing on the claims became final, unless the claim is previously prescribed.\n\u00a0\n",
