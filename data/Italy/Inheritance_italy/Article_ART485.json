If within this period he has begun it but has been unable to complete it, he may obtain from the court of the place where the succession opened an extension, which, except in serious circumstances, shall not exceed three months. \nAfter this period has elapsed without the inventory having been completed, the successor is considered the heir pure and simple.\nOnce the inventory has been completed, the successor who has not yet made the declaration pursuant to ART484 has a period of forty days from the date of the completion of the inventory to deliberate whether he accepts or renounces the inheritance. After this period has elapsed without his having deliberated, he shall be considered heir pure and simple.\n\n",
