    "content": "\n551\nLEGACIES IN LIEU OF LEGITIMACY\nIf a legatee is left a legacy in lieu of the legitimacy he can waiver the legacy and claim the legitimacy.\nIf he prefers to attain the legacy, he loses the right to ask for a supplement, in case the value of the legacy is less than that of the legitimacy, and he does not acquire the quality of heir. This provision does not apply when the testator has expressly granted the legatee, the right to request the supplement.\nThe legacy in lieu of the legitimacy is borne by the unavailable portion. If, however, the value of the legacy exceeds that of the legitimacy due to the legitimary, for the excess the legacy is borne by the available portion.\n\u00a0\n",
