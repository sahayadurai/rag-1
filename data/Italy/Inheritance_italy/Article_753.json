If one of the co-heirs objects, the court shall decide. If the coheirs divide the estate in its current state, the encumbered real estate shall be estimated by the same criteria by which the other real estate is estimated, deducting from its value the principal amount corresponding to the performance, according to the rules concerning the redemption of the annuity, unless there is a special agreement concerning the principal amount to be paid for the enfranchisement.\nOnly the heir, in whose share said property falls, shall be obliged to pay the annuity, with the obligation to guarantee the co-heirs.\n\n",
