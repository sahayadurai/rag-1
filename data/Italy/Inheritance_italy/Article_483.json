If the inherited properties are insufficient to satisfy such legacies, the legacies written in other wills are also reduced proportionately. If some legatees have already been satisfied in full, an action of recovery is given against them.\nThe burden of proving the value of the inheritance is on the heir.\n\u00a0\n",
