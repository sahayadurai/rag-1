The minutes shall be signed by the person presenting the will, the witnesses and the notary public. Attached to it shall be the paper on which the will is written, endorsed on each half-sheet by the notary public and witnesses, and the abstract of the testator's death certificate or a copy of the order ordering the opening of the absentee's last will or the judgement declaring the presumed death.\nIn cases where the will has been deposited by the testator before a notary public, publication is carried out by the depository notary public.\nUpon publication, the holographic will shall be executed.\nFor justifiable reasons, upon the application of any person having an interest, the court might order that periods or phrases of a non-patrimonial content might be deleted from the will and omitted in the copies that might be requested, unless the court orders the release of full copies.\n\n",
