    "content": "\n518\u2028SEPARATION CONCERNING REAL PROPERTY\nWith respect to real property and other property capable of being mortgaged, the right to separation is exercised by the registration of the claim or legacy over each of the same property. The inscription is made in the manner established for inscribing mortgages, stating the name of the deceased and that of the heir, if known, and stating that the inscription itself is taken by way of separation of property. The title need not be produced for such an inscription.\nEntries by way of separation, even if made at different times, all take the rank of the first and prevail over transcripts and entries against the heir or legatee, even if earlier.\nThe rules on mortgages apply to inscriptions by way of separation.\n\n",
