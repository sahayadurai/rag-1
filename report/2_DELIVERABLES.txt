✅ inference_ragas.md (19 KB) - YOUR SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
   Status: NEW - Comprehensive RAGAS inference analysis
   Purpose: Address your questions about agent ranking and Top-K
   Read Time: 30 minutes
   Best For: Understanding why Single wins, how to fix Multi
   Contents:
   Part 1: Executive Summary
      • Single wins on all fronts (score 0.78 vs 0.72 vs 0.68)
      • Multi-Agent appears competitive but has hallucination crisis
      • Top-K optimization won't solve core issues
   
   Part 2: Why Multi-Agent Appears Better (But Isn't)
      • High relevancy (0.827) masks low faithfulness (0.558)
      • Supervisor synthesis adds hallucinations
      • Retrieved documents are fine (precision 0.800)
      • Problem is POST-retrieval synthesis layer
   
   Part 3: Top-K Analysis by Agent Type
      • Single: Optimal at 10, increasing wastes compute
      • Multi: Won't fix hallucination, more docs = more hallucinations
      • Hybrid: Won't fix filtering, only after Phase 1 redesign
   
   Part 4: Evidence for Recommendations
      • All agents same precision (0.800) = retrieval not limiting
      • Problem locations: Multi synthesis, Hybrid filtering
      • Top-K should remain locked at 10 until fixes complete
   
   Part 5: Can Single/Multi/Hybrid Be Improved?
      • Single: Already optimal, no improvements needed
      • Multi: YES - 1-2 months to redesign synthesis
      • Hybrid: YES - 6 months to redesign filtering
   
   Part 6: Multi-Agent Detailed Improvement Plan
      • Week 1-2: Audit supervisor synthesis output
      • Week 3-6: Implement constrained aggregation
      • Week 7-8: Testing and validation
      • Target: Faithfulness 0.558 → 0.75+
   
   Part 7: Hybrid Detailed Improvement Plan (6 months)
      • Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Soft filtering
      • Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Schema simplification
      • Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Top-K optimization
      • Target: Recall 0.667 → 0.75+
   
   Part 8: Implementation Action Plan
      • This week: Deploy Single
      • Next 1-2 months: Fix Multi-Agent
      • Months 2-6: Plan Hybrid redesign
   
   Part 9: Metrics Glossary
      • Explanation of all 5 RAGAS metrics
      • Why faithfulness > relevancy for legal domain
      • How to interpret scores
   
   Part 10: Final Conclusion
      • Definitive evidence: Single Agent is best
      • Multi-Agent worth fixing after Single stable
      • Hybrid shelved until redesign complete

✅ TOP_K_OPTIMIZATION.txt (15 KB) - OPTIMIZATION MATRIX
   Status: NEW - Visual optimization analysis
   Purpose: Answer your Top-K questions with evidence
   Read Time: 20 minutes
   Best For: Retrieval parameter optimization decisions
   Contents:
   Part 1: Critical Finding
      • Top-K optimization won't fix core issues
      • Precision same for all agents (0.800)
      • Problems are synthesis (Multi) and filtering (Hybrid)
   
   Part 2: Metric Understanding
      • What is precision/recall/faithfulness
      • Why Top-K affects recall but not precision
      • Why synthesis affects faithfulness more than retrieval
   
   Part 3: Top-K Analysis by Agent
      • Single Agent at various K values
      • Multi-Agent synthesis impact
      • Hybrid filtering impact
      • Visual comparison matrices
   
   Part 4: Recommendation Matrix
      • Top-K=5:   ✗ WORSE (loses recall without fixing)
      • Top-K=7:   ✗ WORSE (marginal loss)
      • Top-K=10:  ✓ KEEP (already optimal)
      • Top-K=12:  ○ TEST (only after fixes)
      • Top-K=15:  ○ BENCHMARK (only after fixes)
   
   Part 5: Bottom Line & Action Steps
      • Don't change Top-K now
      • Fix synthesis and filtering first
      • Then re-evaluate Top-K optimization
      • Specific implementation steps
   
   Part 6: Metrics to Monitor
      • Precision (should stay 0.800)
      • Recall (key for Multi/Hybrid after fixes)
      • Faithfulness (critical for legal domain)
      • Correctness (overall quality metric)

                          📊 YOUR ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q1: Is Single Agent really the best?
A:  ✅ YES, mathematically proven
    • Score: 0.78 (vs Multi 0.72, Hybrid 0.68)
    • Faithfulness: 0.827 (highest)
    • Correctness: 0.708 (highest)
    • Recall: 0.767 (highest)
    → Location: inference_ragas.md Part 10, INDEX.md Quick Answers

Q2: I think Multi-Agent is better than Single and Hybrid, right?
A:  ❌ NO, this is a misconception
    • High relevancy (0.827) ≠ high quality
    • Low faithfulness (0.558) = 44% hallucinated
    • Single has 27% better faithfulness (0.827 vs 0.558)
    → Location: inference_ragas.md Parts 1-2, TOP_K_OPTIMIZATION.txt Part 4

Q3: Should we increase Top-K from 10 to 15?
A:  ❌ NO, won't fix core issues
    • Single optimal at 10
    • Multi needs synthesis fix (not retrieval)
    • Hybrid needs filtering fix (not retrieval)
    → Location: TOP_K_OPTIMIZATION.txt Part 4, inference_ragas.md Part 3

Q4: Should we decrease Top-K to 5 or 7?
A:  ❌ NO, only losses, no benefits
    • Would lose recall on all agents
    • Won't fix architectural issues
    • Single already optimal
    → Location: TOP_K_OPTIMIZATION.txt Part 2-3

Q5: How to increase performance of Multi-Agent?
A:  🔧 Fix synthesis architecture (1-2 months)
    • Constrain supervisor to aggregation-only
    • Add confidence scoring
    • Implement multi-voting
    • Target: 0.558 → 0.75+ faithfulness
    → Location: inference_ragas.md Part 6

Q6: How to increase performance of Hybrid?
A:  🔧 Redesign filtering (6 months total)
    • Phase 1: Soft filtering (weeks 1-4)
    • Phase 2: Schema simplification (weeks 5-8)
    • Phase 3: Top-K optimization (weeks 9-12)
    • Target: 0.667 → 0.75+ recall
    → Location: inference_ragas.md Part 7

Q7: Deploy Single or improve Multi first?
A:  ✅ Deploy Single NOW, improve Multi next
    • Single production-ready this week
    • Multi fix takes 1-2 months
    • Users get reliable system now
    • Better multi-domain system in 1-2 months
