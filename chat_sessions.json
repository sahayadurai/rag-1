Legal triggers for such a request may include disputes over asset ownership, financial contributions, or the need to protect one spouse's interests due to the other spouse's actions.\n\nIn practical terms, a court can order the division of assets, which may include real estate, bank accounts, and shares in companies. For instance, courts have confirmed equal division of assets, as seen in cases where properties and financial contributions were assessed. Courts may also order one spouse to pay a specific amount to the other, along with interest, and can address procedural issues and costs related to the proceedings.\n\nThese insights are supported by recent legal cases in Slovenia, which illustrate the court's approach to asset division and the factors considered in determining financial contributions and ownership rights.",

For example, dispositions in favor of a notary or witnesses involved in a will are considered null and void (Article 597). Similarly, a will lacking proper form, such as a signature, is also null (Article 606).\n\n2. **Voidable Contract**: A voidable contract, on the other hand, is valid until one party chooses to void it. This type of contract remains enforceable unless the party with the right to void it decides to do so. The context of voidable contracts is less explicitly covered in the retrieved documents, but generally, they would allow for certain remedies or confirmations unless acted upon.\n\n**Consequences**:\n- For void contracts, there are no legal obligations or rights arising from them, and they cannot be enforced by either party.\n- For voidable contracts, the party with the right to void the contract can choose to affirm it, which would allow it to remain in effect.\n\nIn summary, while the documents primarily address the validity of wills and testamentary dispositions, the general principles of void and voidable contracts apply similarly in broader civil law contexts.",

In practice, the court will net amounts by evaluating the contributions of each party to the joint property and any claims made, ensuring that the division reflects the equitable interests of both spouses. The court's decisions are guided by the family law act and property act, as seen in recent rulings where joint assets were divided, and compensation was awarded based on the evidence presented.",
