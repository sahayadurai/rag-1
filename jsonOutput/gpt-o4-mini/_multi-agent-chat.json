        "content": "In civil law, the distinction between a void contract and a voidable contract is significant, and it affects the enforceability of the agreements.\n\n1. **Void Contract**:\n   - A void contract is an agreement that is not legally enforceable from the moment it is created. This means that it has no legal effect and cannot be ratified or enforced by either party. Common reasons for a contract being void include illegality (e.g., contracts for illegal activities), lack of capacity (e.g., contracts with minors or mentally incapacitated individuals), or absence of a lawful object.\n   - **Consequences**: Since a void contract is treated as if it never existed, neither party can enforce the terms of the contract, and there are no legal obligations or rights arising from it.\n\n2. **Voidable Contract**:\n   - A voidable contract, on the other hand, is a valid contract that may be legally enforced unless one party chooses to void it. This typically occurs when one party has the right to rescind the contract due to certain circumstances, such as misrepresentation, undue influence, duress, or a party's lack of capacity at the time of the agreement.\n   - **Consequences**: The party with the right to void the contract can choose to affirm it or rescind it. If they choose to void it, the contract is treated as if it never existed, similar to a void contract. However, until the party decides to void it, the contract remains valid and enforceable.\n\nIn summary, a void contract is never valid, while a voidable contract is initially valid but can be declared invalid at the discretion of one party.",

This involves showing that the defendant's actions (or lack of action) fell short of the standard of care expected in the circumstances.\n\n3. **Causation**: There must be a direct link between the breach of duty and the harm suffered by the plaintiff. This is often divided into two parts:\n   - **Actual Cause** (or \"cause in fact\"): The plaintiff must show that the harm would not have occurred \"but for\" the defendant's breach.\n   - **Proximate Cause**: The harm must be a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions.\n\n4. **Damages**: The plaintiff must have suffered actual damages or injury as a result of the breach.
