        "content": "**Short answer:**  \nNo. While you are still married under Estonia’s statutory “joint‑property” (community‑property) regime you cannot unilaterally sell “your half” of a marital asset, nor can you force a division of that asset. Any disposition of the property must be done with the other spouse’s consent or by a court order issued in a divorce‑ or joint‑property‑division proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### Why the law works that way  \n\n| Legal source | What it means for you |\n|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Art. 26 (1) Family Law** – principle of unity of joint property | The spouses own the whole pool of joint property together; a separate “50 % share” does not exist until the jointness is terminated. A spouse may not dispose of his or her share in a single object. |\n| **Art. 26 (1) (cont.)** | A spouse cannot request a division of joint property **while the jointness is still in force**. |\n| **Art. 37 (2)** – administration of joint property | Until the jointness is terminated, the ordinary rules for possession, use and disposal apply, which prohibit a unilateral sale of a “half”. |\n| **Art. 37 (1) & (3)** – division after termination | Division (by sale, allocation of ownership, or other method) can only be ordered **after** the jointness ends – either by divorce, annulment, or a separate civil action to terminate jointness. The default split is ½‑½ unless the spouses agree otherwise. |\n\n### Practical consequences\n\n1. **You cannot sell “your half” on your own.**  \n   - The asset is owned jointly, so you have no legal right to treat a 50 % portion as your own alienable share.  \n   - A sale is possible only if **both spouses agree** (e.g., you both sign a contract to sell the property and split the proceeds) **or** if a **court orders** the sale as part of a division of joint property.\n\n2. **You cannot force a division while the marriage continues.**  \n   - The only ways to obtain a division are:  \n     * **Divorce/annulment** – file the divorce (or annulment) and, together with that proceeding, request the court to divide the joint property.  \n     * **Separate civil action** – file a suit to terminate the jointness of property; after termination the court will order the division.  \n     * **Mutual agreement** – both spouses sign a written agreement (a marital‑property contract) that terminates jointness and specifies how the assets are to be divided.\n\n3. **What you can do now**  \n   - **Negotiate** with your spouse. If you reach an agreement to sell the asset and split the proceeds, you can do so without court involvement, provided the agreement is in writing and signed by both parties.  \n   - **Apply to the court** for a division of joint property. The court may:  \n     * Order the asset to be sold and the proceeds divided, or  \n     * Allocate the whole asset to one spouse and compensate the other with other assets or cash.  \n   - **Proceed with divorce** (or a separate termination action) if you cannot obtain consent. The court will then handle the division as part of that proceeding.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- While the marriage (and the joint‑property regime) is still in effect, the marital assets form an **indivisible whole** owned by both spouses.  \n- You **cannot** sell “your half” or compel a split on your own.  \n- To separate your interests you must either obtain your spouse’s consent to a sale or obtain a **court order** by filing for divorce (or a separate termination action) and requesting the division of joint property.  \n\nUntil a court order or a mutual agreement is in place, the asset remains jointly owned and cannot be disposed of unilaterally.",

        "content": "When an inherited immovable (a house, land, etc.) cannot be physically divided among the heirs, most civil‑law systems give the court the power to have the property sold and to distribute the money according to each heir’s share.  The sale is usually carried out by public auction, because that is the simplest way to obtain a market price and to treat all heirs equally.\n\n**How this works in practice depends on the national law**\n\n| Country / Legal tradition | What the law allows |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Estonia** (Art. 159) | If the object cannot be divided and the co‑successors cannot agree who should receive it, the property **must be sold** – either by a public auction or by a private auction among the heirs. The proceeds are then divided proportionally to the size of each heir’s share. |\n| **Italy** (Art. 719) | A sale is permitted **only when heirs holding more than half of the estate agree** that the sale is necessary (e.g., to pay debts). The sale may be private among the heirs; a public auction is required only if there is opposition from other interested parties (legatees, creditors). The law does **not** automatically order a public auction simply because the property is indivisible. |\n| **Other civil‑law jurisdictions** (e.g., France, Spain, Germany) | The general principle is the same: the court may order a forced sale (usually by public auction) when the property cannot be partitioned and the heirs cannot reach an agreement. The proceeds are then allocated in proportion to each heir’s statutory share. |\n\n### Why the two specialist answers seem to differ\n\n*The “inheritance_codes” answer* reflects the **statutory rule** in Italy: a forced sale needs the consent of heirs representing more than 50 % of the estate, and a public auction is only a fallback when there is dissent from other parties.\n\n*The “inheritance_cases” answer* cites a **specific court decision** in Italy where the appellate court ordered a sale and divided the proceeds. That case likely involved the required consent of the majority of heirs (or other legal grounds such as the need to satisfy debts), so the court was able to order the auction. The case illustrates that, once the procedural requirements are met, the court can indeed order a public auction and apportion the proceeds.\n\nThus, there is no real contradiction: the law sets the conditions under which a forced sale may be ordered, and the case shows the court applying those conditions.\n\n### Bottom line for your question\n\n- **Yes**, a court can order a public auction of an indivisible inherited real estate and split the proceeds among the heirs, **provided the applicable national law’s procedural requirements are satisfied**.\n- In **Estonia**, the sale is mandatory when the property cannot be divided and the heirs cannot agree.\n- In **Italy**, the sale (public or private) is possible only if heirs holding more than half of the estate consent; a public auction is used when there is opposition from other interested parties.\n- In most other civil‑law countries, the court similarly has the authority to order a forced sale and distribute the money proportionally, but you should check the specific statutes or case law of the relevant jurisdiction to confirm the exact procedure.",

Any disposition made before that would be void.\n\n---\n\n**Slovenia (community‑property regime)**  \nSlovenian family law (Zakon o zakonski zvezi – Family Law) creates a *community of property* (skupno premoženje) that includes assets acquired during the marriage, except for personal property. The key provisions are:\n\n| Provision | Effect |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Art. 71‑72** – definition of community property | Both spouses own the community jointly, each holding an undivided one‑half share. |\n| **Art. 73** – disposition of a spouse’s share | Each spouse may freely dispose of **his or her own share** (sell, gift, bequeath, etc.) without the other spouse’s consent. |\n| **Art. 74** – disposition of the whole community | Any alienation that would affect the entire community (e.g., selling the whole house) requires the **written consent of the other spouse** (or a court order). |\n| **Art. 75** – protection of the other spouse’s interest | The disposing spouse must not prejudice the other spouse’s rights; a court can intervene if the transaction is manifestly detrimental. |\n| **Formalities** | For immovable property a notarial deed and registration in the land register are required; the same consent rule applies. |\n\n**Result:** In Slovenia you **may sell or gift your one‑half share** of the marital property while you are still married. You do **not** need your spouse’s permission to deal with that share alone. However, if you want to dispose of the whole asset (e.g., sell the entire house) you must obtain your spouse’s written consent (or a court order). The transaction must also respect the usual formalities for the type of property involved.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n| Country | Can you sell/gift your share while married? |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Estonia** | **No** – the law forbids any disposition of a spouse’s share in joint property until the marriage ends or the joint estate is formally divided. |\n| **Slovenia** | **Yes** – you may dispose of your one‑half share freely; only a disposition of the whole community requires the other spouse’s consent (or a court order). |\n\nIf you are in Estonia, you would need to wait for divorce, death, or a formal division of the joint estate before you can sell or gift any part of the marital property. In Slovenia, you can proceed with selling or gifting your share now, but be sure to follow the required notarial and registration formalities and to respect any protective provisions that safeguard your spouse’s interests.",

        "content": "**What the Italian Civil Code says**\n\nWhen the inheritance consists of a single, indivisible immovable (e.g., an apartment that cannot be physically split), the rule is found in **Article 720 of the Civil Code**.  \nThe article gives the judge three possible ways to dissolve the hereditary community:\n\n1. **Buy‑out (compensazione in denaro)** – one heir (or a third party) may be authorised to acquire the shares of the other heirs by paying them the value of their quota.  \n2. **Allocation of the whole asset to a single heir** – the court may assign the entire apartment to one heir and order the others to receive a cash amount equal to their share.  \n3. **Public auction** – if the parties cannot agree on a buy‑out or on an allocation, the judge must order the sale of the indivisible property at a public auction; the proceeds are then divided among the heirs in proportion to their quotas.\n\nThe code therefore does **not** make the auction the only possible outcome; it is the “last‑resort” mechanism after the first two alternatives have been examined.\n\n**How the courts actually apply the rule**\n\nItalian case law shows that judges follow the hierarchy set out in Art. 720:\n\n| Case (year) | Situation | Court’s solution |\n|-------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| **2020, n. …** | Two heirs of an undivisible apartment could not reach any agreement. | **Public auction** of the apartment; proceeds split equally. |\n| **2023, n. 1205** | Two heirs of a Naples apartment. | **Allocation** – the whole apartment was given to one heir; the other paid the co‑heir a cash amount equal to his share. |\n| **2015, n. 1160** | Four co‑owners of a building that could not be split. | **Buy‑out** – each heir received a cash amount equal to one‑fourth of the building’s value. |\n| **2014, n. 9959‑14 (Rome)** | One apartment in Viterbo, parties dead‑locked. | **Public auction** after dissolution of the community. |\n\nFrom these examples we can draw two clear points:\n\n1. **Auctions are ordered, but only when the parties cannot settle on a buy‑out or an allocation.**  \n2. **In many cases the judge prefers a cash compensation or an allocation**, because these solutions avoid the time‑consuming and often costly auction procedure.\n\n**Why the two agents seemed to disagree**\n\n- The second agent quoted a simplified reading that “the asset must be sold by public auction.” That wording reflects the *practical* outcome in many judgments, but it omits the statutory alternatives provided by Art. 720.  \n- The first agent gave the full statutory text and correctly described the judicial hierarchy, which is why its answer is more complete.\n\n**What you and your siblings can do**\n\n1. **Negotiate a private solution first** –  \n   *One sibling could buy the others’ shares* (paying the market value of the quota), or  \n   *One sibling could keep the whole apartment* and compensate the rest with cash.  \n   This is usually faster, cheaper, and avoids the auction’s uncertainty.\n\n2. **If negotiations fail, ask the court to intervene under Art. 720**.  \n   The judge will first examine whether a buy‑out or an allocation is feasible.  \n   Only if those options are rejected will the court order a **public auction** of the apartment.\n\n3. **Prepare the necessary documentation** (valuation of the property, proof of each heir’s quota, any offers of purchase). A notary will be appointed to conduct the auction if it becomes necessary.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n- The Civil Code (Art. 720) gives three possible ways to dissolve an inheritance that includes an indivisible apartment: buy‑out, allocation, or, as a last resort, public auction.  \n- Italian courts do order auctions, but they usually try the cash‑compensation or allocation routes first; auctions are used when the heirs cannot reach any agreement on those alternatives.  \n\nIf you can reach an agreement among yourselves, you can avoid the auction altogether. If not, the court will ultimately ensure the property is sold and the proceeds are split according to each sibling’s share.",

      },

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "**Judicial separation of assets (razveza premoženja) in Slovenia**  \nThe possibility to ask a court to “separate” the spouses’ property is provided for in the **Family Code (Zakon o zakonski zvezi in družinskih razmerjih – ZZDR‑1)**, especially in Articles 90‑96 and the provisions on provisional measures (Art. 102‑105). It is a distinct procedural tool that can be used **outside of, or alongside, divorce or dissolution proceedings**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. When may a spouse request it?\n\n| Legal trigger | What the law says / typical judicial interpretation |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Existence of a marriage contract (prenuptial agreement) that allows a change of regime** | If the spouses have concluded a marriage contract that provides for “separation of assets” (or for a later change of regime), either spouse may ask the court to give the contract effect. The request can be made **at any time** during the marriage. |\n| **Imminent or actual risk that the other spouse will dissipate, hide or otherwise prejudice the marital property** | The court may grant a **provisional separation of assets** (preliminary measure) when one spouse threatens to waste or conceal assets, e.g. by transferring them abroad, selling them below market value, or incurring large debts that would jeopardise the other spouse’s share. |\n| **Divorce or dissolution proceedings** | While the final division of property is normally decided in the divorce judgment, a spouse may request a **temporary (pre‑judgment) separation of assets** to preserve the estate until the final ruling. This is common when the parties are in conflict and one fears that the other will dispose of the property before the divorce is finalised. |\n| **Mutual agreement to separate property during the marriage** | Even without a marriage contract, spouses can jointly apply for a judicial separation of assets. The court will examine whether the request is made in good faith and whether the separation does not contravene public order (e.g., it cannot be used to evade creditors). |\n| **Special circumstances defined by the court** | The judge may, of his/her own initiative, order a separation of assets if the circumstances (e.g., bankruptcy of one spouse, serious marital breakdown) make it necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the other spouse. |\n\n**Key point:** The request can be filed **by either spouse** at any moment, but the court will look for a concrete reason (risk of dissipation, need to preserve the estate, or a contractual basis) before granting a separation that affects the legal regime of the marital property.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What can the court actually order?\n\n### A. **Provisional (pre‑judgment) measures**\nThese are temporary orders that stay in force until the court issues a final decision on the separation or until the divorce/divorce‑related property division is concluded.\n\n| Order | Practical effect |\n|-------|------------------|\n| **Freeze or immobilise bank accounts, securities, or other financial assets** | No withdrawals, transfers or encumbrances are allowed without the court’s permission. |\n| **Appoint a custodian / administrator of the joint estate** | A neutral third‑party (often a notary or a court‑appointed expert) manages the assets, collects income, pays necessary expenses, and reports back to the court. |\n| **Inventory and valuation of the marital property** | An expert (usually a court‑appointed appraiser) prepares a detailed list of movable and immovable assets, debts, and their market values. |\n| **Prohibit the sale, lease or mortgage of jointly owned real estate** | The property may only be dealt with after the court’s explicit consent. |\n| **Separate management of income** | Each spouse may be ordered to keep his/her own earnings in a separate account, preventing commingling. |\n| **Interim division of specific assets** | The court can allocate the use of a family home to one spouse (e.g., for the benefit of minor children) while the other receives a monetary compensation pending final division. |\n\n### B. **Final (binding) orders**\nWhen the court decides that a **judicial separation of assets** should be permanent, it can:\n\n| Order | Practical effect |\n|-------|------------------|\n| **Change the marital property regime** | The marriage is converted from “community of property” (skupno premoženje) to “separate property” (ločeno premoženje) or to a mixed regime as stipulated in the marriage contract. |\n| **Register a separation agreement** | If the spouses have reached a settlement, the court can order its registration with the competent court registry, giving it the force of a notarial deed. |\n| **Allocate specific assets to one spouse** | The court may award particular immovable property (e.g., the family house) or movable assets (e.g., a car, business) to one spouse, with the other receiving either other assets or monetary compensation. |\n| **Order compensation for contributions** | If one spouse has contributed significantly (e.g., through work, care of children, or financial input) the court can order the other spouse to pay a **compensatory amount** (often called “contribution compensation”). |\n| **Settle debts and obligations** | The court can decide which spouse is responsible for existing debts, or it can order that debts be paid from the joint estate before the separation takes effect. |\n| **Determine the handling of pensions and retirement benefits** | In Slovenia, pension rights accrued during the marriage are considered part of the marital estate; the court can order a split or a transfer of pension entitlements. |\n| **Issue enforcement measures** | If a spouse fails to comply with the order (e.g., refuses to transfer a property), the court can impose fines, enforce seizure, or, in extreme cases, initiate criminal proceedings for contempt. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the process usually unfolds in practice\n\n1. **Petition** – The requesting spouse files a written petition with the competent district court, stating the legal basis (e.g., risk of dissipation, existing marriage contract) and the specific relief sought.\n2. **Evidence** – The petitioner must attach evidence: the marriage contract (if any), bank statements, property titles, proof of attempts to conceal assets, etc.\n3. **Court hearing** – The judge hears both parties. If the other spouse contests, the court may order an **expert appraisal** and may set a deadline for the parties to reach an agreement.\n4. **Provisional order (if needed)** – The judge may immediately issue temporary measures to preserve the estate while the case proceeds.\n5. **Decision** – After evaluating the evidence, the court issues a **final judgment** either:\n   * granting a permanent separation of assets (changing the regime), or  \n   * refusing the request (if no legal trigger is found), or  \n   * ordering a **partial** separation (e.g., only certain assets are separated, while the rest remain under the community regime).\n6. **Registration** – Any change of regime or separation agreement is entered into the court’s register, giving it public force.\n7. **Enforcement** – The judgment is enforceable like any other civil judgment; the losing party must comply or face enforcement actions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary of the key take‑aways\n\n* **Legal triggers** – a marriage contract that provides for separation, a real risk that the other spouse will waste or hide assets, or the need to preserve the estate during divorce/divorce‑related proceedings.\n* **Who can ask?** – either spouse, at any time during the marriage.\n* **Court’s toolbox** – provisional freezes, appointment of a custodian, inventory and valuation, interim allocation of use, and, ultimately, a permanent change of the marital property regime, allocation of specific assets, monetary compensation, and debt allocation.\n* **Practical reality** – Slovenian courts are cautious not to allow a separation that would prejudice creditors or be used as a “sham” to evade obligations; they therefore require concrete evidence of risk or a contractual basis before granting a separation.\n\nIf you are considering filing such a request, it is advisable to gather **financial documentation**, **any existing marriage contract**, and, if possible, obtain a **preliminary legal opinion** from a family‑law attorney who can draft the petition in the form required by the district court. This will increase the likelihood that the court will grant the provisional and/or final measures you need.",

        "content": "**Void contract vs. voidable contract (civil‑law systems)**  \n\n| Aspect | **Void contract** (nullité, *nulle*) | **Voidable contract** (annullable, *annulable*) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Legal effect when the contract is formed** | **No legal effect from the start** – it is as if the contract never existed. | **Valid and enforceable** until the party entitled to set it aside actually does so. |\n| **Typical causes** | • Illegality (the object or cause is prohibited by law) <br>• Lack of essential formalities required by law (e.g., a deed that must be notarised) <br>• Contravention of a mandatory rule of public policy (e.g., a contract to commit a crime) <br>• Absence of a required element of consent (e.g., the parties are not legally capable of contracting at all). | • Defect in consent that can be cured by the injured party (e.g., **mistake**, **duress**, **fraud**, **misrepresentation**, **incapacity of one party** that is not absolute) <br>• Violation of a protective statutory rule that gives a party a *right* to avoid the contract (e.g., consumer‑credit cooling‑off period). |\n| **Can the contract be ratified?** | No – a void contract cannot be ratified because it never existed legally. | Yes – the party who could avoid it may **ratify** (affirm) the contract, after which it becomes fully effective and no longer voidable. |\n| **Who may invoke the defect?** | Anyone (the contract is void *ab initio*; the court will declare it void on its own motion or on any party’s request). | Only the party whose consent is impaired (or, in some statutes, a protected third party). The other party cannot unilaterally declare the contract void. |\n| **Effect on obligations** | All obligations are **null**; no performance is required. If any performance has already been rendered, the parties must be **restituted** (return what they have received) to the extent possible (restitutio in integrum). | Until the contract is annulled, the obligations **continue**. If the injured party elects to annul, the contract is **rescinded** and the parties are restored to their pre‑contract position (again, restitution of benefits, possibly plus damages). |\n| **Consequences for third‑party rights** | Because the contract never existed, any rights that would have arisen from it (e.g., registration of a mortgage, transfer of title) are **invalid**. | While the contract remains in force, third‑party rights are valid. After annulment, the effect on third parties depends on the jurisdiction’s rules on **protective registration** and **good‑faith acquisition** (e.g., a buyer who acquired rights in good faith may retain them, or the contract may be declared ineffective against them). |\n| **Prescriptive period** | Usually none – a void contract can be declared void at any time. | The right to avoid is subject to a **prescriptive/limitation period** (e.g., 2 years from discovery of fraud, 30 days for consumer cooling‑off). Failure to act within that period results in loss of the right to annul. |\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What a **void contract** looks like in practice  \n\n*Example (French law)* – A contract to sell a piece of land that is **prohibited** by a zoning ordinance. Because the object is illegal, the contract is **null and void** under Art. 1128 of the French Civil Code. The parties cannot be forced to perform; any transfer of title that may have been recorded is considered never to have taken effect, and the parties must return any consideration received.\n\n*Key consequence* – The contract is treated as if it never existed. No party can be held liable for non‑performance, but the law may require **restitution** of any benefits already exchanged (e.g., return of the purchase price, return of the land). No ratification is possible.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  What a **voidable contract** looks like in practice  \n\n*Example (German law)* – A consumer signs a loan agreement while under **duress** (the lender threatens to withhold essential medication). The contract is **annullable** under § 123 BGB (fraud, duress, mistake). The consumer may **annul** the contract within a statutory period (generally 2 years from the removal of the duress). Until the consumer does so, the loan is enforceable; the lender may demand repayment. If the consumer annuls, the contract is rescinded and the parties must restore what they have received, and the consumer may also claim damages for the duress.\n\n*Key consequence* – The contract is **valid** until the injured party exercises the right to annul. The party may also **ratify** (affirm) the contract, after which it becomes fully effective and the right to annul disappears.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Practical consequences for the parties  \n\n| Situation | Void contract | Voidable contract (not yet annulled) | Voidable contract (after annulment) |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Performance required?** | No – no duty exists. | Yes – duties continue until annulment. | No – duties are extinguished. |\n| **Right to recover what was given?** | Yes – restitution (return of consideration) is the default remedy. | Yes, but only after the contract is annulled; until then the parties must continue performance. | Yes – restitution plus possibly **damages** for loss caused by the defect. |\n| **Possibility of damages for breach?** | Generally **no** (there is no breach because there was no contract). | Yes – the non‑injured party can sue for breach while the contract is still in force. | Yes – the injured party may claim damages for the loss caused by the defect (e.g., fraud). |\n| **Effect on registration or third‑party rights** | Any registration based on the contract is void; third parties cannot acquire rights. | Registrations are valid while the contract is in force; after annulment they may be challenged, but good‑faith third parties may be protected. | Same as “void” for the contract itself, but the law may protect third parties who acted in good faith (e.g., “buyer in good faith” rules). |\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Summary of the main differences  \n\n1. **Moment of legal existence** – A void contract **never** exists legally; a voidable contract **does** exist until the injured party decides otherwise.  \n2. **Who can invoke the defect** – Anyone can point out a void contract; only the party whose consent is impaired (or a protected statutory class) can invoke voidability.  \n3. **Possibility of ratification** – Void contracts cannot be ratified; voidable contracts can be ratified, after which they become fully effective.  \n4. **Prescriptive limitation** – Void contracts can be declared void at any time; voidable contracts are subject to a limitation period for the right to annul.  \n5. **Consequences** – Both lead to restitution, but only a voidable contract can generate **damages for breach** while it is still operative, and only a voidable contract can be **affirmed** and thereby become irrevocably binding.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Quick checklist for practitioners  \n\n| Question | If “Yes” → likely **void** | If “No” → likely **voidable** |\n|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Does the contract’s **object** or **cause** violate a mandatory rule of law? | ✔︎ → void | – |\n| Is a **required formal act** (e.g., notarisation, registration) missing where the law makes it indispensable? | ✔︎ → void | – |\n| Is one party **incapable of giving consent** (e.g., minor, mentally incapacitated) **without a protective statute**? | – | ✔︎ → voidable (annullable) |\n| Was consent obtained through **mistake, fraud, duress, undue influence**? | – | ✔︎ → voidable |\n| Does the law give a **specific right to rescind** (e.g., consumer cooling‑off period)? | – | ✔︎ → voidable |\n| Can the contract be **ratified** by the party whose consent is defective? | No | Yes (if the party chooses to ratify) |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n\n- A **void contract** is a legal nullity from the outset; it produces no obligations and cannot be ratified. The parties must unwind any benefits exchanged.  \n- A **voidable contract** is a valid contract that one party may **avoid** because of a defect in consent or a protective statutory rule. Until avoidance, it operates like any ordinary contract; after avoidance, it is rescinded and the parties are restored, often with restitution and possibly damages.  \n\nUnderstanding which category applies determines whether the parties must simply unwind the transaction (void) or whether they retain the option to keep it alive, to ratify it, or to unwind it and claim damages (voidable).",

Each element must be shown on the “balance of probabilities” (i.e., it is more likely than not that the element exists).\n\n| Element | What the plaintiff must show |\n|---------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Duty of care** | That the defendant owed a legal duty to act (or refrain from acting) in a particular way toward the plaintiff.  The existence of a duty is usually inferred from the relationship between the parties, the foreseeability of harm, the nature of the activity, or a statutory/common‑law rule. |\n| **2. Breach of that duty** | That the defendant failed to meet the standard of care required by the duty.  The standard is typically that of a “reasonable person” in the same circumstances (or a professional standard for experts).  The plaintiff must show the defendant’s conduct fell short of what a reasonable person would have done. |\n| **3. Causation** (two sub‑parts) | **a. Factual (or “but‑for”) causation:** The plaintiff must prove that, but for the defendant’s breach, the injury would not have occurred.  <br>**b. Legal (or “proximate”) causation:** The injury must be a foreseeable consequence of the breach and not too remote; the chain of events must not be broken by an intervening cause that is superseding. |\n| **4. Damages** | That the plaintiff suffered actual loss or injury that is compensable (e.g., personal injury, property damage, economic loss).  Without a demonstrable loss, there is no liability even if the first three elements are satisfied. |\n\n**In short:** To succeed on a negligence claim, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed a duty, breached that duty, that the breach caused the plaintiff’s loss, and that the plaintiff actually suffered compensable damages.  If any one of these elements is missing, the claim for non‑contractual (tort) liability for negligence fails.",

If one spouse’s acquired assets exceed the other’s, the spouse with the smaller share is entitled to **½ of the difference** as a financial claim for set‑off. |\n| **Art. 53 (2)** | The set‑off claim cannot exceed the value of the assets that remain with the obliged spouse after all other obligations have been satisfied. |\n| **Art. 56** | The court may, at the request of the obliged spouse, **reduce, waive or postpone** the claim when strict application would be unfair or would hinder rational management of the estate. |\n\n### How the court “nets” the amounts in practice\n\n1. **Identify each spouse’s acquired assets** – this includes cash, movable and immovable property, and the monetary value of any jointly‑owned claim that each spouse can still enforce after the divorce.\n\n2. **Calculate the total value for each spouse** – add up all acquired assets (including the value of the joint claim that each spouse can claim).\n\n3. **Determine the difference** – subtract the smaller total from the larger total.\n\n4. **Apply the statutory set‑off rule (Art. 53 (1))** – the spouse who ends up with the smaller total receives **½ of the difference** as a set‑off claim. In effect, the spouse with the larger total must transfer that amount (or an adjusted amount) to the other spouse.\n\n5. **Observe the limitation (Art. 53 (2))** – the set‑off amount cannot be larger than the value of the assets that will remain with the obliged spouse after all other obligations (e.g., debts, maintenance obligations) have been satisfied.\n\n6. **Court’s discretionary adjustment (Art. 56)** – if paying the full set‑off would be unreasonable (for example, the obliged spouse lacks liquid funds), the court may, upon request, **reduce the amount, release the spouse from payment, or postpone it**.\n\n### Practical result\n\n- The jointly‑owned receivable is treated as part of each spouse’s acquired‑asset total.  \n- After the court has calculated the half‑difference, the receivable (or its monetary value) is **netted** against the other spouse’s share: the spouse who would otherwise receive more assets transfers the calculated amount to the disadvantaged spouse.  \n- If the strict half‑difference would be unfair, the court can modify the amount under Art. 56.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Yes**, a claim owned jointly can be used for set‑off, but only against a claim that is either prescribed by law or agreed upon by the spouses (Art. 26).  \n- The court equalises the parties’ positions by comparing their total acquired assets, calculating the half‑difference, and applying that as a set‑off claim (Art. 53), with the possibility of reduction, waiver, or postponement if fairness requires (Art. 56).  \n\nThus, in a property‑division dispute the court will first assess the net value of each spouse’s assets—including the joint receivable—then “net” the amounts by granting the disadvantaged spouse half of the excess as a set‑off claim, adjusting the amount as necessary to avoid undue hardship.",
