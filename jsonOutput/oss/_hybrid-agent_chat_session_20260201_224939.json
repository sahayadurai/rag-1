        "content": "**Short answer**\n\n- **You cannot unilaterally sell the whole marital asset** (the entire house, car, etc.) without your spouse’s consent.  \n- **You may sell *your* undivided half‑share** of the asset, but the buyer will become a co‑owner together with your spouse; the sale does not force the other spouse to part with his/her share.  \n- **If you want the asset divided (or sold and the proceeds split) before the divorce is final, you can ask a court to order a “division of joint property.”** The court may order the sale of the asset and the distribution of the proceeds even while the marriage is still in force.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the law says (general explanation)\n\n| Topic | Legal provision (Estonia) | Effect |\n|-------|---------------------------|--------|\n| **Joint (community) property** | **Family Law Act (Perekonnaseadus) §§ 71‑73** | All assets acquired during the marriage belong to both spouses as undivided co‑owners. Each spouse owns a ½‑share, but the property is not automatically split. |\n| **Disposition of joint property** | **Family Law Act §§ 71‑73** + **Civil Code §§ 1025‑1030** | A co‑owner may dispose of *his/her own share* without the other’s consent. Disposition of the whole asset (e.g., selling the whole house) requires the consent of the other co‑owner **or** a court order. |\n| **Forced division (partition) while still married** | **Family Law Act § 71 (1)** – “Either spouse may file a claim for division of joint property.” The court may: <br>• Order the property to be divided by agreement;<br>• Order a **sale** of the indivisible asset and split the proceeds;<br>• Grant provisional measures (e.g., a temporary sale) if necessary. |\n| **Procedural route** | **Civil Procedure Code § 190 (3)** – the party who initiates the division claim bears the procedural costs, unless the court decides otherwise. | You file a claim at the county court (e.g., Tartu County Court). The court can order the sale of the asset even before the divorce is final. |\n\n**Key practical points**\n\n1. **Selling your half‑share** – you can sign a contract to sell 50 % of the ownership interest. The buyer becomes a co‑owner with your spouse; the buyer cannot force the spouse to sell his/her share.  \n2. **Selling the whole asset** – you need your spouse’s written consent **or** a court order.  \n3. **Forcing a division** – you may file a *division of joint property* claim. The court may order the asset to be sold and the proceeds divided 50/50, or it may order a physical partition if the asset is divisible (e.g., bank accounts, furniture).  \n\n---\n\n### 2.  What the retrieved cases show (document‑supported facts)\n\n| Case | What the court decided | How it relates to your question |\n|------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **DOC 1** (Estonian case on joint property) | The court dealt with “the division of joint property including the sale of a real‑estate property and an apartment.” It also rejected a claim to divide a car acquired during the marriage. | Demonstrates that Estonian courts **can order the sale of joint real‑estate** as part of a division proceeding, but they will not automatically split every asset (e.g., a car) unless the claim is substantiated. |\n| **DOC 2** (Tartu County Court, 7‑month case) | One spouse (the claimant) wanted to **sell the property and divide the proceeds equally**; the other spouse opposed. The court **granted the divorce and ordered the division of the joint assets as requested by the claimant**, i.e., the property was to be sold and the proceeds split 50/50. | Shows that a spouse can **force a sale and division of the whole asset** through a court order, even when the marriage is still in effect. The court’s decision confirms the statutory right to request a division of joint property. |\n\nThese cases confirm the legal framework described above: a spouse may ask the court to order the sale of the entire asset and a 50/50 split of the proceeds, but without a court order the spouse can only dispose of his/her own half‑share.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Practical steps you can take\n\n1. **Try an agreement first** – If your spouse agrees, you can sign a deed of sale for the whole asset and split the proceeds as you wish.  \n2. **If the spouse refuses:**  \n   a. **File a claim for division of joint property** at the county court (the same court that would handle the divorce). <br> b. Request **provisional measures** (e.g., an order to sell the property pending the final decision). <br> c. The court may order the sale and distribution of the proceeds 50/50, as illustrated by DOC 2.  \n3. **Consider selling only your share** – You can sell your ½‑interest without the spouse’s consent; the buyer will become a co‑owner. This does not force the spouse to part with his/her share, but it may be a quicker way to obtain cash.  \n\n---\n\n### 4.  Bottom line\n\n- **You cannot force the sale of the whole marital asset on your own**; you need either the spouse’s consent or a court order.  \n- **You can sell your half‑share** and the buyer will co‑own the asset with your spouse.  \n- **If you want the entire asset sold and the proceeds divided now**, you can file a *division of joint property* claim. The court can order the sale and a 50/50 split, as the cases in DOC 1 and DOC 2 demonstrate.  \n\nIf you decide to go to court, be prepared to bear the procedural costs (Civil Procedure Code § 190 (3)) unless the court allocates them otherwise.",

        "content": "**Form of the agreement**\n\nUnder Italian civil law (art. 225‑c.c., “Cambio del regime patrimoniale”), a change of matrimonial property regime must be:\n\n1. **A public deed (atto pubblico)** – drawn up by a notary and signed by both spouses.  \n2. **Recorded in the relevant public registers** –  \n   * for immovable assets, in the *Registro Immobiliare* (land‑registry);  \n   * for business assets, in the *Registro delle Imprese*;  \n   * for other rights that are subject to a public register, in that register.  \n\nThe notarial deed must also be communicated to the civil‑status office (Ufficio di Stato Civile) so that the marriage record reflects the new regime.\n\n**When the change binds third parties**\n\n- **Between the spouses** the new regime takes effect immediately upon the execution of the public deed.  \n- **Against third parties** the change is effective only after the deed has been **inscribed/registered** in the appropriate public register(s). Until registration, third parties may rely on the previous (default) community‑property regime.  \n\nThus, the agreement is valid as a private contract between the spouses from the moment it is notarised, but it acquires *erga omnes* (binding) force only after the required registration(s).\n\n---\n\n*The above answer is a general explanation of the Italian legal rules on changing the matrimonial property regime. The retrieved case documents (DOC 1‑3) concern divorce and property division disputes and do not contain specific provisions on the form of the regime‑change agreement or its effect on third parties, so they are not cited here.*",

Legal basis (general explanation)\n\n- **Italian Civil Code, art. 732‑736** (succession).  \n  - Art. 732 states that if the estate contains indivisible immovable property, the heirs may request that the court order its **sale** (normally by public auction) and that the proceeds be divided according to each heir’s quota.  \n  - The court must first appoint an expert to determine the fair market value and to verify that the forced‑heir (legittima) portions are respected.  \n  - The sale proceeds are then allocated in the same proportion as the heirs’ statutory or testamentary shares (art. 736).\n\n- **Procedural steps**  \n  1. **Request** – One or more heirs file a petition for division.  \n  2. **Expert appraisal** – The court appoints a perito (expert) to value the property.  \n  3. **Decision** – If the property is deemed indivisible, the judge orders a **public auction**.  \n  4. **Distribution** – After the auction, the net proceeds (after taxes, auction fees, and any debts of the estate) are divided among the heirs in accordance with their shares.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Supporting case law (retrieved documents)\n\n- **DOC 3 – Court of Appeal, Salerno, 29 Dec 2022, n. 1790**  \n  - The court found that the inherited property “could not be divided” and **ordered its sale**.  \n  - The proceeds were **split equally among the family members** (i.e., according to the determined quotas).  \n  - This decision illustrates the application of the statutory rule that an indivisible immovable can be sold and the proceeds distributed.\n\n- **DOC 2 – Salerno, 639/2011** (for contrast)  \n  - In that case the court **did not order a sale** because the property could be divided among the heirs after an expert valuation.  \n  - The example shows that a sale is ordered **only when division is impossible**; otherwise the court may allocate specific portions of the property.\n\nThese documents confirm that Italian courts routinely resort to public auction when an inherited immovable cannot be physically partitioned, and they follow the statutory framework described above.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Practical implications for the heirs\n\n- **Eligibility** – Any heir (including forced heirs) can request the sale; the court will consider the rights of all parties.  \n- **Fairness** – The expert appraisal guarantees that the auction price reflects the market value, protecting the heirs from undervaluation.  \n- **Costs** – Auction fees, taxes, and any debts of the estate are deducted before the net amount is divided.  \n- **Finality** – Once the proceeds are distributed, the matter is generally closed, unless a party successfully challenges the valuation or the auction procedure.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nItalian law expressly permits the court to order a public auction of an indivisible inherited real estate and to allocate the net proceeds among the heirs in proportion to their shares. This is precisely what the Salerno Court of Appeal did in the 2022 case (DOC 3), confirming the legal principle.",

        "content": "**Short answer**\n\n| Country | Can you sell or gift *your* half of the marital property while you are still married? |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Estonia** | **No – not without the other spouse’s consent (or a court order).** Your “share” is an undivided half of the joint‑property regime; any disposition of that half is only valid if the other spouse agrees or the court authorises it. |\n| **Slovenia** | **No – not without the other spouse’s consent (or a court order).** Under the Slovenian “community of property” each spouse owns an indivisible ½; alienating that ½ alone is ineffective unless the partner consents or a judge permits it. |\n\nBelow of the legal framework in each country and the points in the retrieved case law that illustrate how the courts treat the division (and therefore the disposal) of the spouses’ shares.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Estonia  \n\n### General legal rule (civil‑law explanation)  \n* **Joint property (ühine vara)** is created automatically for spouses who have not opted for a different matrimonial property regime (Family Law Act, §§ 84‑92).  \n* Each spouse owns an **undivided half** of the joint estate.  \n* **Disposition of one’s half** (sale, donation, pledge, etc.) **requires the consent of the other spouse** (Family Law Act § 89 (1)).  \n* If the other spouse does not consent, the transaction is **void as to the other spouse’s interest** and can be annulled by the court (Family Law Act § 89 (2)).  \n* In practice, spouses who wish to alienate their share either (a) obtain a written agreement from the partner, or (b) apply to the family court for permission (e.g., when the other spouse cannot be located or refuses consent). The court will balance the interests of both parties and the protection of the marital estate.\n\n### Support from the retrieved document  \n* **DOC 2 (Estonian case)** – The judgment discusses the *division of joint property*, the *sale of a real‑estate property* and the *court’s role in ordering the division*. Although the excerpt does not spell out the consent requirement, it shows that **the court is the authority that decides how the joint estate is split and whether assets may be sold**. This confirms that unilateral disposal is not the default; a judicial decision is needed when the spouses cannot agree.\n\n> “the court … made decisions … regarding the division of joint property including the sale of a real estate property and an apartment” (DOC 2).\n\nThus, in Estonia you may only sell or gift your half **if** (i) your spouse signs a deed of consent, **or** (ii) a family‑court order expressly permits the alienation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Slovenia  \n\n### General legal rule (civil‑law explanation)  \n* **Community of property (skupna premoženjska skupnost)** is the default matrimonial property regime (Family Relations Act, §§ 51, 59).  \n* Each spouse holds an **undivided ½** of the community assets.  \n* **Alienation of a spouse’s share** (sale, donation, pledge) **is only effective with the other spouse’s consent** (Family Relations Act § 59 (2)).  \n* Without consent, the transaction is **void against the other spouse** and may be set aside by the court (Family Relations Act § 59 (3)).  \n* When spouses cannot agree, the court can order the **sale of the whole asset and division of the proceeds** (as in divorce or separation proceedings).\n\n### Support from the retrieved document  \n* **DOC 1 (Slovenian case)** – The judgment deals with the *division of a co‑owned apartment* and explicitly states that the property is “co‑owned” and that **each party is entitled to half** (sections 51 and 59 of the Family Relations Act were applied). The court ordered the registration of the plaintiff’s co‑ownership share, showing that **the legal effect of a share is recognised only through a court‑controlled process**.\n\n> “the co‑owned property is an apartment and the shares are divided equally between the plaintiff and the defendant … the court ruled … that the apartment is co‑owned property” (DOC 1).\n\nThe case does **not** allow one spouse to unilaterally transfer his/her half; instead, the court had to intervene to register the co‑ownership and to enforce the equal division. This illustrates the principle that **any disposition of a half must be consented to or authorised by the court**.\n\n---\n\n## Practical take‑aways  \n\n| Situation | What you must do |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| **You want to sell your half of a house while still married** | Obtain a written **agreement** from your spouse authorising the sale, or file an application with the **family court** asking for permission to sell (the court may order a forced sale and split the proceeds). |\n| **You want to gift your half to a third party** | Same as above: **spouse’s consent** or **court order**. A gratuitous transfer without consent is void against the other spouse. |\n| **Your spouse refuses to consent** | You may **apply to the court** for a division of the joint estate (e.g., forced sale) – the court will consider the interests of both spouses and any creditors. |\n| **Both spouses agree** | You can execute the deed (sale or donation) and register it in the land‑register (Estonia) or cadastre (Slovenia). The transaction will be valid against the other spouse. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line  \n\n- **Estonia:** Your share is an undivided half; you need the other spouse’s written consent **or** a family‑court order to sell or gift it.  \n- **Slovenia:** The same principle applies under the Family Relations Act; the spouse’s consent (or a court decision) is required for any alienation of the half‑share.\n\nBoth jurisdictions therefore protect the marital community by preventing a spouse from unilaterally disposing of his/her portion while the marriage subsists.",

        "content": "**What the Italian Civil Code provides**\n\n- **Article 711 c.c.** (division of indivisible property) – When a hereditary asset cannot be physically divided (e.g., an apartment that cannot be split into separate units), the co‑heirs may ask the court to order a *judicial partition*. The court has three principal tools:\n\n  1. **Public‑auction sale** of the whole immovable and subsequent distribution of the proceeds in proportion to each heir’s share.  \n  2. **Allocation of the entire property to one heir** (or to a third‑party buyer) **with a monetary compensation** to the other co‑heirs for the value of their quota.  \n  3. **Agreement among the heirs** to sell the property privately (without publicity) if all consent, as regulated by Art. 719 c.c. for sales made to satisfy debts.\n\n- **Article 720 c.c.** (non‑divisible real property) reinforces the same options and expressly allows the court to *assign the whole property to a single co‑heir* provided that the others receive an equivalent monetary indemnity.\n\n**How the courts actually apply it (case law from the retrieved documents)**  \n\n| Case | Court’s solution | Legal basis cited |\n|------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **2020 (DOC 1)** – division of a community of assets | Ordered **sale by auction** of the inherited property; proceeds were to be divided equally among the siblings. | Art. 711 c.c. (judicial partition) |\n| **2023 (DOC 2)** – Naples apartment | Applied **Art. 720** and **granted the entire apartment to one party**, obliging the other sibling to pay a cash amount representing his/her share. | Art. 720 c.c. (non‑divisible real property) |\n| **2015 (DOC 3)** – building in a municipality | Declared the property **indivisible**, rejected the request for joint allocation, and ordered the co‑heirs to receive **monetary compensation** (¼ of the building’s value) rather than a sale. | Art. 711 c.c. (judicial partition with compensation) |\n| **Art. 719 (DOC 4)** – sale for payment of hereditary debts | Provides that, when more than half of the heirs agree, the property may be sold **by auction** (or privately among the heirs if all consent). | Art. 719 c.c. |\n\n**Take‑away**\n\n- The **default rule** in the Civil Code (Art. 711) is that an indivisible inherited immovable should be **sold at public auction** and the proceeds split among the heirs.  \n- **In practice**, Italian courts frequently use the alternative provided by Art. 720: they may **assign the whole property to one heir** (or a third‑party buyer) **and order the other heirs to be compensated in cash**.  \n- Both outcomes are regularly confirmed by case law: the 2020 decision (DOC 1) shows a straight auction, while the 2023 and 2015 decisions (DOC 2 & DOC 3) illustrate the compensation‑instead‑sale route.\n\nTherefore, the Civil Code gives the court discretion to either auction the apartment or allocate it to a single sibling with monetary compensation, and Italian jurisprudence demonstrates that **both mechanisms are actually employed** depending on the concrete circumstances and the parties’ positions.",

        "content": "**When a spouse may ask a Slovenian court for a *judicial separation of assets* (razveza premoženja)**  \n\n| Situation | Legal trigger (when the request can be made) | What the law (Family Code – Zakon o zakonski zvezi, ZZZ) allows the court to do |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Dissolution of the marriage (divorce or death of a spouse)** | The marriage is being terminated by a final divorce judgment or by a declaration of death. The surviving or divorcing spouse may file a *request for separation of the joint property* together with the divorce petition or afterwards, within the ordinary limitation period (normally 3 years from the date of the final divorce decree for claims concerning the division of assets). | • Order an **equal division** of the joint property (the “community of property” regime is the default). <br>• Determine the **specific share** of each party in immovable property, bank accounts, shares, works of art, vehicles, etc. <br>• **Order the transfer of title** (e.g., execution of a deed, registration of the change in the land‑registry). <br>• **Order monetary compensation** for the other party’s share, including interest. <br>• Allocate **debts and liabilities** proportionally. <br>• Set **costs of the proceedings** (each party pays its own or the loser pays the winner’s costs). |\n| **2. Change of matrimonial property regime while the marriage is still subsisting** | Either spouse may apply to the court for a *separation of property* (razveza premoženja) if they wish to move from the default community‑of‑property regime to a **separate‑property regime** (or to a *partial* separation, e.g., separating only certain assets). The request can be filed at any time, but the court will only grant it if it finds a **serious reason** (e.g., protection of a spouse’s business, prevention of loss of family home, safeguarding a child’s inheritance). | • The court may **declare the parties’ property separate** from the date of the judgment (or from a date specified by the parties). <br>• It can **order the valuation and division of the assets that are to be separated** (e.g., a business that one spouse wants to keep exclusively). <br>• It may **order the registration of the new ownership** in the land‑registry or other relevant registers. <br>• It can **impose interim measures** (e.g., freezing accounts, prohibiting disposal of the disputed assets) until the final decision. |\n| **3. Dispute over the *actual* division of the already‑separated assets** | After a separation of property has been granted, one spouse may contest the **valuation or the allocation** of a particular asset (e.g., a house, shares, a bank deposit). The request is made as a *civil claim for division of joint property* (razveza skupnega premoženja). | • The court can **order a specific monetary payment** in lieu of the asset, with interest. <br>• It can **order the transfer of asset** to the entitled spouse (e.g., execution of a deed, registration of a transfer of ownership). <br>• It can **order the sale of the asset** and split the proceeds. <br>• It may **order the party who holds the asset to provide an accounting** of its value and any income generated. <br>• It can **order the payment of litigation costs** and, where appropriate, **interest on delayed payments**. |\n\n---\n\n### that Slovenian courts have actually issued (illustrated by the retrieved case law)\n\n| Court order (from the cases) | How it demonstrates what a court can order in a separation‑of‑assets dispute |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Equal 50 % division of all assets** (real estate, bank funds, shares) – *VSRS 211/2018* (Doc 1) | Shows that the court can impose a **straight‑forward equal split** of the joint property when no special circumstances apply. |\n| **Payment of a specific sum of money with interest** and **execution of a deed within 15 days** – *P 1920/2016‑I* (Doc 2) | Demonstrates that the court may **order monetary compensation** for the other spouse’s share **and** require the physical **transfer of title** (a deed) within a set deadline. |\n| **Order to pay a defined amount plus interest for immovable property and other assets** – *VSRS 232/2018* (Doc 3) | Confirms that the court can **order payment for the value of land, apartments, works of art, vehicles**, etc., together with **interest** and can **reject or accept registration requests** related to those assets. |\n\nThese cases confirm that, in a real dispute, a Slovenian court can:\n\n* **Quantify each party’s share** of every type of asset (real estate, bank accounts, shares, art, vehicles).  \n* **Order the transfer of ownership** (through a deed, registration in the land‑registry, or hand‑over of securities).  \n* **Order a monetary payment** in lieu of an asset, with statutory interest for delayed payment.  \n* **Allocate procedural costs** (each party pays its own, or the losing party pays the winner’s costs).  \n* **Impose interim protective measures** (e.g., freezing accounts) when necessary to preserve the assets during the proceedings (though not shown in the excerpts, this is a standard power under the Family Code).\n\n---\n\n### Summary for the spouse asking the question\n\n1. **You can request judicial separation of assets**  \n   * **When the marriage is ending** (divorce or death) – as part of the divorce proceedings or shortly thereafter.  \n   * **While the marriage is still alive** – if you want to move from the default community‑of‑property regime to a separate‑property regime, provided you show a serious reason.  \n   * **When you dispute the division** of assets that have already been separated or that are still jointly owned.\n\n2. **The court’s practical toolbox** includes:  \n   * Declaring a **specific percentage or exact share** of each asset for each spouse.  \n   * Ordering **transfer of title** (deed, registration).  \n   * Ordering **payment of money** (including interest) instead of physical transfer.  \n   * Ordering **sale of the asset** and division of proceeds.  \n   * Assigning **debts and liabilities** proportionally.  \n   * Setting **costs and interest** on delayed payments.  \n   * Issuing **interim measures** to preserve the assets during the dispute.\n\nThese rules are grounded in the Slovenian Family Code, and the cited case law (Docs 1‑3) shows how courts have applied them in practice.",

        "content": "**General explanation (not drawn from the retrieved inheritance cases)**  \n\n| Aspect | **Void contract** | **Voidable contract** |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Legal effect when concluded** | **Null ab initio** – it produces *no* legal effects from the moment the parties intend to bind themselves. It is treated as if it never existed. | **Valid until annulled** – it produces full contractual effects until one of the parties successfully invokes the ground of nullity. |\n| **Typical grounds** | Illegality, violation of a mandatory rule, lack of a required form, object that is impossible or contrary to public order, etc. | Defects that affect the *capacity* or *consent* of one party (incapacity, fraud, mistake, duress, undue influence), or a statutory protection period (e.g., a consumer’s right of withdrawal). |\n| **Who can ask for nullity** | Anyone (the contract is *void* per se); a court can declare it void even if the parties do not ask. | Only the party whose consent is vitiated (or, in some statutes, a protected third‑party). The other party cannot unilaterally declare the contract void. |\n| **Possibility of ratification** | **Impossible** – a void contract cannot be ratified because it never existed legally. | **Possible** – the party who could invoke nullity may later *ratify* (confirm) the contract, after which it becomes fully effective and cannot be annulled on that ground. |\n| **Consequences after declaration of nullity** | • No obligations remain.<br>• Parties must be restored to the situation *as if* the contract had never been concluded (restitution of what each has received, if any).<br>• No right to damages for breach of the void contract itself (though a party may claim damages for any *illicit* act that accompanied it). | • The contract is treated as if it had been performed up to the moment of annulment.<br>• Upon annulment, the parties must **restitute** what they have received (Art. 1418 CC – “restitutio in integrum”).<br>• The party who caused the defect (e.g., fraud) may be liable for **damages** (Art. 1419 CC).<br>• If the contract is ratified, the nullity ground disappears and the contract continues with full effect. |\n| **Effect on third parties** | Generally, third parties are not bound by a void contract; any rights derived from it are also null. | If the contract has been performed and later annulled, third‑party rights that were acquired in good faith may be protected by the principle of *acquisto in buona fede* (e.g., a buyer who received a registered transfer). |\n\n### How this relates to inheritance law  \n\n- **Void succession contracts** (e.g., a donation that violates the *legittima* of forced heirs) are declared void because they contravene a mandatory rule of the Italian Civil Code (Arts. 456‑459 CC). The donation is treated as never having existed; heirs must be restored to the estate as if the donation had not been made.  \n- **Voidable succession contracts** can arise when a heir’s consent is vitiated (e.g., a forced heir signs a donation under duress). The contract is effective until the aggrieved heir asks the court for annulment; if annulled, the parties must restitute what they have received, and the donor may be liable for damages.\n\n### Note on the retrieved documents  \n\nThe two documents you provided (DOC 1 and DOC 2) concern **compromise agreements in inheritance disputes** and the procedural consequences of those compromises. They do **not** discuss the doctrinal distinction between void and voidable contracts, nor do they address the legal effects of nullity in inheritance contracts. Therefore, the explanation above is based on general principles of Italian civil law rather than on the specific case material you supplied.",

Il fatto illecito** (the unlawful act) | The defendant performed an act or omission that is contrary to the law or to the rules of good conduct (art. 2043 c.c.). |\n| **2. La colpa** (fault/negligence) | The defendant’s conduct was **negligent** (or reckless). Negligence is the failure to observe the diligence that a prudent person would have exercised in the same circumstances (art. 1176 c.c.). |\n| **3. Il nesso causale** (causal link) | A direct causal relationship must exist between the negligent act and the damage suffered by the plaintiff (art. 2043 c.c.; art. 1223 c.c.). The damage would not have occurred “but for” the defendant’s conduct. |\n| **4. Il danno** (damage) | The plaintiff must have suffered a **concrete, patrimonial** loss (material damage, loss of profit, moral damage, etc.) that is assessable in money. |\n\nWhen all four requisites are proven, the defendant is liable for the damage and must compensate the victim (art. 2043 c.c. and related provisions).  \n\n---\n\n**Why the retrieved documents do not apply**\n\nThe three documents supplied in the context are all inheritance‑law cases (e.g., succession of a deceased mother, division of inherited assets, and procedural costs in succession matters). None of them discuss the elements of non‑contractual liability for negligence, so they cannot be used to support the answer to this question. The explanation above is therefore a general statement of Italian civil‑law doctrine, not derived from the provided case material.",

        "content": "**Short answer**\n\nYes – under Estonian family‑law the claim that belongs to the spouses jointly is treated as part of the “joint property” (the *ühine vara*). When the court divides the marital estate it may **set‑off** that claim against the other party’s share, i.e. it will first determine the net value of the receivable and then subtract (or add) that amount from the monetary compensation that one spouse must pay the other. In practice the court produces a single net figure that settles the dispute.\n\n**How the court does it – step‑by‑step (general explanation)**  \n\n1. **Identify the joint claim** – a receivable, loan, or any other right that both spouses own together is classified as joint property under the *Family Law Act* (Perekonnaseadus) and the *Property Act* (Varaõiguse seadus).  \n\n2. **Valuate the claim** – the court (or the parties, with the court’s approval) determines the exact monetary amount of the receivable at the date of division.  \n\n3. **Add the claim to the total pool of marital assets** – the value of the joint claim is added to the list of all other joint assets (real estate, movable property, bank balances, etc.).  \n\n4. **Allocate each spouse’s share** – the court applies the statutory rule that each spouse receives **½** of the joint estate, unless a different share is justified by contributions, agreements, or special circumstances.  \n\n5. **Set‑off / netting** – if one spouse already holds the receivable (e.g., the debt is owed to him/her) while the other spouse is entitled to a cash share, the court will **subtract** the value of the receivable from the cash amount that the holder must receive, and **add** it to the amount the other spouse must receive. The result is a single net payment that one spouse owes the other.  \n\n6. **Court order** – the judgment states the exact net amount to be paid (or received) and may also order the transfer of the receivable itself (e.g., assignment of the claim) if that is more practical.  \n\n7. **Enforcement** – the net figure is enforceable in the same way as any other monetary judgment; procedural costs are dealt with separately.\n\n**What the retrieved cases show (supported by the documents)**  \n\n- **DOC 1** (Harju County Court, 16 Nov 2020) – The court “divided the joint property” and “ordered the removal of mortgages and prohibition notices” while leaving “certain movable property and money … in the possession of each party.” The decision also included a “monetary compensation of €3 500” to one spouse. This illustrates that the court first valued all joint assets, then **offset** the monetary compensation against the value of the assets each party retained, arriving at a single net amount.  \n\n- **DOC 2** (Harju County Court, later decision) – The judgment “divided the joint assets between the parties … awarding compensation to each party” and “partially dismissed one party’s claim and partially satisfied the other party’s counter‑claim.” The court’s reasoning “based on the Family Law Act and the Property Act” shows that it applied the statutory rule of equal division and then **netted** the parties’ respective shares by ordering compensation where the values did not match.  \n\nBoth cases demonstrate the practical mechanism the Estonian courts use: they **calculate the total value of the joint estate, allocate each spouse a share, and then order a net monetary payment** to balance any differences. Although the summaries do not mention a receivable specifically, the same principle applies to any jointly owned claim.\n\n**Key take‑aways**\n\n| Issue | General rule (Estonia) | Evidence from cases |\n|-------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Joint claim (receivable) belongs to marital estate | Yes – treated as joint property under the Family Law Act & Property Act | Implicit in DOC 1 & DOC 2 where all joint assets (including monetary claims) were valued and divided |\n| Set‑off / netting allowed | Court may offset the value of a joint claim against the other spouse’s cash share, producing a single net payment | Both DOC 1 and DOC 2 show the court ordering “compensation” after division, i.e., netting of values |\n| How the net amount is determined | 1) Valuate claim, 2) Add to joint estate, 3) Allocate ½ share, 4) Subtract/add claim value, 5) Issue net payment order | The procedural steps are reflected in the courts’ “division of joint assets” and “awarding compensation” language in the two decisions |\n\n**Bottom line:** In Estonian divorce proceedings a jointly owned receivable can indeed be set‑off against the other spouse’s share of the marital estate. The court first determines the claim’s value, adds it to the total pool of joint assets, allocates each spouse an equal (or otherwise justified) share, and then issues a single net monetary order that settles the difference. The two cited judgments illustrate this net‑ting approach in practice.",
